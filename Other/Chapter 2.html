    <h1> Chapter 2 </h1>
    
    <h2>Rude</h2>
    
    <p>We humans are rude. Rude to fellow humans, rude to animals, rude to ourselves. Even the nicest of the nice have been rude at one point in our lives.  </p>
    
    <p>Imagine that scientists built a machine enabling us to look back at our life without the mental strain of remembering it. Look back to when you were an infant. Most rudeness in our actions occurs as babies. You scream in the middle of the night, waking up the whole house because you did something in your diaper. Could be considered rude. You wave your hands and smack mother on the nose. Also rude. But you were a baby. You didn't know anything. </p> 
    
    <p>Go forward a few years. You are now 3 years old. Your parents have instructed you on proper manners and rights and wrongs. Toddlers don't care about manners unless someone doesn't use their manners with them. You run up to someone at the playground and snatch their toy. In our society, rude. You push your sibling to get up front when on a walk. Rude. You're still learning, so people accept it, no matter how much it annoys them. A toddler is an emotionally unstable pint-sized dictator with the uncanny ability to know exactly how far to push a person towards utter insanity before reverting to a loveable creature. 
    
    <p>Now you are around 10, in or nearing junior high. This is also where a <strong>lot</strong> of rudeness occurs. </p>
