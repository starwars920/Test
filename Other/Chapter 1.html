    <h2>Average</h2>
    
    <p>I am a person who lives an average life in an average place during an average time and so on. Every weekday I direct my time to my studies and every weekend I relax and shove my nose into some books or video games. Every week, every month, every year. Pretty much everyone can relate to this at some point. Notice though how I didn't say I was an average person. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. Who gets to decide though? Some people say everyone is special but if everyone is special, it makes everyone normal. I don't understand this logic. Maybe it's just me, like I wasn't told the secret. So I've decided to question things in life, such as junior high sterotypes and first impression judgements. I promise you that this is not fiction, sort of a non-fiction novel.</p>
