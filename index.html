<h1 class = "turquoise">Hello world</h1>
<p class = "blue">Hello world is most commonly the first thing coders learn to code. It's an inside joke for all you computing nerds like me. I've made this website so I'm obviously not new to this so this webpage is for all you beginning coders who need a simple how-to for coding.</p>
<h2 class = "turquoise">Introduction</h2>
<p class = "blue"> There is a LOT of coding languages out there and I'm not gonna have a clue on which you want to learn so let's keep this simple. This web-page will be specifically de-bugging, the popular webpages you can use, variable defintions, and so on. Let's get started!</p>
<h3 class = "turquoise">Popular Coding Languages</h3>
<p class = "blue">Your computer is like another person. When you code, you're basically having a conversation with it. One small problem is that computers speak in binary (Lots of 1s and 0s). Us humans can learn binary but who really wants to type out 01100101 01110110 01100101 01110010 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101001 01101110 01100111? (Try to figure out what I typed in binary!) So lots of genius people got together and created coding languages. Now there are probably thousands of coding languages all over the world. Here are a few commonly used ones that you may reconigize. </p>
   <p class = "blue">Javascript, HTML, Java, Ruby, Python, CSS, etc.</p>
   <p class = "blue">With these coding languages, there is almost no limit to what you can code!</p>
   <h4 class "turquoise">De-bugging</h4>
   <p class = "blue">Imagine yourself finishing up this extremely long and complicated piece of code but when you click Run, it doesn't work. It makes you want to punch the computer in the face right? This means there is a mistake in your code. So to fix it, we do this thing called de-bugging. Did you know that the first computer error was a moth caught in the computer? That's where de-bugging comes from. Most coding languages use semicolons at the end of every line of code to tell the computer "Hey! I want you to run this!". If you are using a coding language you know uses a semicolon (for example Javascript), check <b class = "red">every</b> line of code to see if you forgot any semicolons. If your language doesn't use a semicolon, try just reading through all your code to check for possible mistakes. If even that won't work, grab another coder and find you mistake. When all else fails, google.</p>
