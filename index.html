<h1 class = "turquoise">Hello world</h1>
<p class = "turquoise">Hello world is most commonly the first thing coders learn to code. It's an inside joke for all you computing nerds like me. I've made this webpage so I'm obviously not new to this so this webpage is for all you beginning coders who need a simple how-to for coding.</p>
<h2 class = "turquoise">Introduction</h1>
<p class = "blue"> There is a LOT of coding languages out there and I'm not gonna have a clue on which you want to learn so let's keep this simple. This web-page will be specifically de-bugging, the popular webpages you can use, variable defintions, and so on. Let's get started!</p>
<h3 class = "turquoise">Popular Coding Languages</h3>
<p class = "blue">Your computer is like another person. When you code, you're basically having a conversation with it. One small problem is that computers speak in binary (Lots of 1s and 0s). Us humans can learn binary but who really wants to type out 01100101 01110110 01100101 01110010 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101001 01101110 01100111? (Try to figure out what I typed in binary!)
