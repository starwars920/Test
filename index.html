<h1 class = "turquoise">   Hello world</h1>

<p class = "blue">   Hello world is most commonly the first thing coders learn to code. It's an inside joke for all you computing nerds like me. I've made this website so I'm obviously not new to this so this webpage is for all you beginning coders who need a simple how-to for coding.</p>

<h2 class = "turquoise">   Introduction</h2>

<p class = "blue">   There is a LOT of coding languages out there and I'm not gonna have a clue on which you want to learn so let's keep this simple. This web-page will be specifically de-bugging, the popular coding languages you can use, variables, loops, and so on. Let's get started!</p>

<h3 class = "turquoise">   Popular Coding Languages</h3>

<p class = "blue">   Your computer is like another person. When you code, you're basically having a conversation with it. One small problem is that computers speak in binary (Lots of 1s and 0s). Us humans can learn binary but who really wants to type out 01100101 01110110 01100101 01110010 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101001 01101110 01100111? (Try to figure out what I typed in binary!) So lots of genius people got together and created coding languages. Now there are probably thousands of coding languages all over the world. Here are a few commonly used ones that you may reconigize. </p>

   <p class = "blue">   Javascript, HTML, Java, Ruby, Python, CSS, etc.</p>
   
   <p class = "blue">   With these coding languages, there is almost no limit to what you can code!</p>
   
   <h3 class = "turquoise">   De-bugging</h3>
   
   <p class = "blue">   Imagine yourself finishing up this extremely long and complicated piece of code but when you click Run, it doesn't work? It makes you want to punch the computer in the face, right? This means there is a mistake in your code. So to fix it, we do this thing called de-bugging. Did you know that the first computer error was a moth caught in the computer? That's where de-bugging comes from. Most coding languages use semicolons at the end of every line of code to tell the computer "Hey! I want you to run this!". If you are using a coding language you know uses a semicolon (for example Javascript), check <b class = "red">every</b> line of code to see if you forgot any semicolons. If your language doesn't use a semicolon, try just reading through all your code to check for possible mistakes. If even that won't work, grab another coder and find you mistake. When all else fails, google.</p> 
    
   <h3 class = "turquoise">Binary</h3>
   
   <p class = "blue">Binary like you already found out in Popular Coding Languages, a language made up of 1s and 0s. Binary is the language of the computer. Most people can't write binary so I have included a list of letters and their binary form and some phrases you can translate. If you want a really good binary to text converter, go to https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html for all your binary needs. (It's where I got all my binary translations and the table below.)</p>

<h3 class = "turquoise">Variables</h3>

<p class = "blue">What is a variable? Well, you've probably heard of it in a mathy setting, x can equal any value you want to give it. Variables in coding are a lot like that. A variable is a sort of container that you can store information in inside your code. Using var you can tell your computer "Hey, I'm (insert age here) years old and I want you to store that information in the variable PinkFluffyUnicornsThatDanceOnRainbows!". Obviously you wanto a variable name that is short and easy to understand if your boss read your code. If you wanted to store an age, you might store it in the variable Age or YearsOld. You can also code your program to when the reader or player are asked a question, they can type in their answer and it will be stored for later. Very cool. But that's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to coding.</p>

<h3 class = "turquoise">Loops</h3>

<p class = "blue">We covered variables, binary, coding languages, and de-bugging so far. Good work, still reading this thing! (And yay me for still typing this!) Now for loops. There are two types of loops, for loops and while loops. Which one do you want to start with, for or while? Too bad, we're starting with for loops. So, say I told you for every year you have been alive, stomp your left foot once. You would stomp your foot for every year you have been born. That's a for loop. While loops are different though. Going back to the stomping of feet, if I told you while I'm stomping my feet, do the macarena. You would do the macarena until I stopped stomping my foot.</p>
